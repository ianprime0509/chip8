# Chip-8 and Super-Chip games

The games contained in this directory were taken from [David Winter's Chip-8
distribution](http://www.pong-story.com/chip8/).  It appears (from the notes in
the original distribution) that the games are freeware, so non-commercial
modification and distribution is allowed (this is not the same as the license
for the main Chip-8 distribution, which allows commercial redistribution as
well).

## Source code

The source code to some of the games was provided in the original distribution,
and has been converted to syntax usable by chip8asm.  For some of the other
games, I've disassembled the binaries with chip8disasm and modified the output
to make it clearer (with comments and nice label names).
