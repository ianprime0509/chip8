# Chip-8

This is a [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator, written in
C.  Currently, all the Chip-8 games I have tested are functional, and some
Super-Chip games are as well (in particular, BLINKY).  Many Super-Chip games
don't quite work yet, though.

The main documentation for the project is its manual, which is generated by GNU
Texinfo and can currently be used in the GNU info format or HTML.

## Building

You can build the project using the following commands (the leading `$` is your
prompt):

```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ meson
$ ninja
```

The executable binaries will be located in `build/src`.  Then, you can run
`ninja info/chip8.info` to build the manual in info format and/or `ninja
info/html` to build the manual in HTML format.

If you get an message about Texinfo not being installed, that means you won't
be able to build the manual until you install it.  You can either install it or
simply ignore it and continue the build.  Additionally, if you have Doxygen
installed and you want some code documentation to be generated, you can run
`meson configure -Ddoxygen=true` and then run `ninja docs/html`.
